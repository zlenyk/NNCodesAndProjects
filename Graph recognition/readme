FOR OSX:
Environment was created with conda, by running conda file:
conda create --name <env> --file req.txt

and then more libraries are installed with pip from requirements.txt, command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

FOR LINUX:
create conda environment with:
conda create --name <env> --file req_linux.txt

next install additionally graphviz library with:
pip install graphviz

in case of troubles with installing matplotlib

usage:
python run -f <graph_image>

Results (generated graph image and DOT file) are located in "results/" folder.

TESTS:
python manager.py -f <first file number> -l <last file number (optional)>

example:
python manager.py -f 100 -l 171
this runs all tests


output of tests:
Number 164 vertices: 8  blobs: 11 BLOBS OVER  edges: 7  real edges: 4  EDGES OVER  ISO FALSE  time: 7.93070006371
means that there were too many vertices and edges recognized, so graph is not isomorphic with correct one

Number 162 vertices: 4  blobs: 4  BLOBS OK    edges: 2  real edges: 2  EDGES OK    ISO OK     time: 5.80566215515
when everything is ok

Dot files are taken from "dot/" directory

configuration can be changed in config.py
